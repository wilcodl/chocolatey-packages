    <description>Delprof2 is the unofficial successor to Microsoft’s Delprof which does not work with operating systems newer than Windows XP. Here are the main facts:

* Delprof2 is syntax compatible to the original Delprof, but more powerful
* Delprof2 lets you explicitly specify which profiles to delete
* Delprof2 bypasses security to delete profiles regardless of current permissions/owner
* Delprof2 supports very long paths
* Delprof2 works on all modern versions of Windows
* Delprof2 is free for personal and commercial use

### What Does it Do?
Delprof2 deletes inactive user profiles. If you want to reclaim disk space just run it without parameters and it will delete all profiles except your own and some special profiles needed by the operating system (like “Default”).

Delprof2 has additional filtering options: you might want to delete locally cached copies of roaming profiles only or delete only those profiles that have not been used in a specified number of days. Delprof2 does it all, both on the local system and remotely. </description>
